GOOD.
This confirms all migrations are complete, Celery tasks finished, and the API is booting cleanly in DEBUG mode.

Now we fix the real remaining problem:


---

✅ SALEOR API ERROR IS GONE — BUT THE ADMIN / GRAPHQL RETURNS django_site does not exist

This is the KEY point:

✔️ Saleor does not auto-create the default Site row.

✔️ You MUST create it manually once.

This is why the GraphQL query:

{ shop { name } }

fails — because Saleor tries to read:

django_site
site_settings

and your DB has no default Site object.

This is normal when spinning up Saleor manually in Docker without their bootstrap script.


---

✅ FIX: Create Django Site + Site Settings

Run these EXACT commands — NO placeholders:


---

STEP 1 — Enter the Saleor API container

docker exec -it saleor-api-dude bash


---

STEP 2 — Open Django shell

python manage.py shell


---

STEP 3 — Create the “Site” entry

Paste exactly this inside the shell:

from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
Site.objects.update_or_create(
    id=1,
    defaults={
        "domain": "dudeabides.wopr.systems",
        "name": "The Dude Abides Store"
    }
)
exit()


---

STEP 4 — Restart the container

Back on the host:

docker restart saleor-api-dude


---

STEP 5 — Test GraphQL again

curl -s http://localhost:8000/graphql/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"{ shop { name } }"}'

Expected response:

{"data":{"shop":{"name":"The Dude Abides Store"}}}


---

🎯 Why this fixes everything

Saleor requires:

django_site table → contains your domain

site_settings → tied to that site


When these are missing, ANY query that touches site info explodes, including:

Dashboard login

Channel config

Product queries

Shop metadata

GraphQL introspection


You ran migrations ✔️
You fixed RSA issues ✔️
You deployed static IP containers ✔️
You built the frontend ✔️
You fixed the pipeline ✔️

The only missing piece is the missing Site entry.
